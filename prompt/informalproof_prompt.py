prompt = fr"""Now please follow the instructions below to convert the Lean 4 code  (indicated by ``Formal proof in Lean 4: '')  into its informal proof, using the informal problem (indicated by ``Problem: '') as a guide. Please write the corresponding informal solution in natural language (indicated by ``Informal proof: '') given the ``# Problem: '' and ``# Formal proof in Lean 4: '', filling in the ``# Informal proof: '' section.

<Instruction>
Analyze the given mathematical theorem and the corresponding Lean 4 code. Provide a detailed explanation of the proof process, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. Theorem structure: Clearly state the theorem, including its assumptions and conclusion.

2. Proof strategy: Explain the overall strategy employed in the proof, focusing on logical reasoning and mathematical deduction rather than calculation.

3. Step-by-step reasoning: Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the proof process, ensuring that each step corresponds to an element in the Lean 4 code.

4. Logical deduction: Emphasize how each step of the proof follows logically from the previous steps or from the given assumptions.

5. Mathematical concepts: Discuss any specific mathematical concepts, notations, or definitions used in the proof, such as divisibility or exponentiation.

6. Abstraction: Present the proof in a general, abstract form that could be applied to similar problems, rather than focusing on specific numerical calculations.

7. Correspondence to code: Ensure that the logical flow of your proof explanation aligns with the structure and tactics used in the Lean 4 code, without explicitly mentioning Lean-specific terminology.

Avoid using syntax or terminology specific to formal proof systems. Instead, focus on presenting a rigorous mathematical argument using general logical principles and mathematical language. The proof should follow the reasoning path implied by the Lean 4 code but be accessible to readers unfamiliar with formal proof assistants.

# Problem: Prove that $x-1 \\\\geq \\\\ln x$ for $x>0$.

# Tags: inequality, logarithm, calculus

# Formal proof in Lean 4: \n```lean\ntheorem lean_workbook_26 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) : x - 1 ≥ Real.log x  :=  by\\n  have h1 : 0 ≤ (x - 1)^2 := sq_nonneg (x - 1)\\nnlinarith [log_le_sub_one_of_pos hx]\n```

# Informal proof: \nTo prove that x - 1 ≥ ln x for x > 0, we can approach this problem using the following reasoning:\n\n1. Let's consider the function f(x) = x - 1 - ln x.\n\n2. We aim to show that f(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0.\n\n3. First, observe that f(1) = 0, as 1 - 1 - ln(1) = 0.\n\n4. Now, let's examine the derivative of f(x):\n   f'(x) = 1 - 1/x\n\n5. Notice that f'(x) > 0 for x > 1 and f'(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1.\n\n6. This implies that f(x) has a global minimum at x = 1.\n\n7. Since f(1) = 0 and this is the global minimum, we can conclude that f(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0.\n\n8. Therefore, x - 1 - ln x ≥ 0 for all x > 0.\n\n9. Rearranging this inequality, we get x - 1 ≥ ln x for x > 0.

# Problem: You only need here is $|\\\\,|x|-|y|\\\\,| \\\\le |x-y|,$ which is easily verified by squaring both sides.

# Tags: proof, inequality, algebra

# Formal proof in Lean 4: \n```lean\ntheorem lean_workbook_96 (x y : ℝ) : |(abs x) - (abs y)| ≤ abs (x - y)  :=  by\\n  have h₁ := abs_abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub x y\\nexact h₁\n```

# Informal proof: \nTo prove that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|, we'll use a logical approach that focuses on the properties of absolute values and inequalities. Here's a proof-oriented reasoning path:\n\n1. Let's consider the left side of the inequality: ||x| - |y||\n\n2. We know that for any two real numbers a and b, |a - b| represents the distance between a and b on a number line.\n\n3. Now, let's think about what |x| and |y| represent geometrically. They are the distances of x and y from 0 on the number line, respectively.\n\n4. So, ||x| - |y|| represents the difference between these two distances.\n\n5. On the other hand, |x - y| represents the direct distance between x and y on the number line.\n\n6. Intuitively, the difference between the distances of two points from 0 cannot be greater than the direct distance between those points.\n\n7. To formalize this intuition, let's consider two cases:\n   a. If x and y have the same sign (both positive or both negative)\n   b. If x and y have different signs\n\n8. In case (a), ||x| - |y|| is exactly equal to |x - y|.\n\n9. In case (b), ||x| - |y|| is strictly less than |x - y|.\n\n10. Combining these cases, we can conclude that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y| always holds.\n\n11. While we could verify this by squaring both sides as suggested, this geometric and case-based approach provides a more intuitive understanding of why the inequality is true.

# Problem: Without using calculator, show that $7^7<2^20$ . (only rules of inequalities).

# Tags: inequality, algebra, number_theory, probability, combination, trigonometry

# Formal proof in Lean 4: \n```lean\ntheorem lean_workbook_436 : 7^7 < 2^20  :=  by\\n  norm_num [show (2 : ℕ) = 2 from rfl]\n```

# Informal proof: \nTo prove that 7^7 < 2^20 without using a calculator, we'll employ a series of logical steps and inequalities. Here's a proof-oriented reasoning path:\n\n1. Let's start by considering the left side of the inequality: 7^7\n\n2. We know that 7 < 8 = 2^3\n\n3. Therefore, 7^7 < (2^3)^7 = 2^21\n\n4. Now, we need to show that 2^21 < 2^20, which seems counterintuitive at first\n\n5. However, we can approach this by considering the ratio of consecutive powers of 2:\n   2^21 / 2^20 = 2\n\n6. This means that 2^21 is twice as large as 2^20\n\n7. If we can show that 7^7 is less than half of 2^21, we'll have proved our inequality\n\n8. Half of 2^21 is 2^20\n\n9. So, we've reduced our problem to showing that 7^7 < 2^20\n\n10. We can further simplify this by considering:\n    7/8 < 1\n\n11. Raising both sides to the 7th power:\n    (7/8)^7 < 1^7 = 1\n\n12. Multiplying both sides by 8^7:\n    7^7 < 8^7 = (2^3)^7 = 2^21\n\n13. And we know from step 8 that 2^20 is half of 2^21\n\n14. Therefore, 7^7 < 2^20

# Problem: $3| 3c\\\\implies 3^2| 3c\\\\implies 3|c---(2)$

# Tags: number_theory, algebra

# Formal proof in Lean 4: \n```lean\ntheorem lean_workbook_490 : 3 ∣ c → 3^2 ∣ 3*c → 3 ∣ c  :=  by\\n  rintro h1 h2\\nsimp [pow_two] at h2\\nomega\n```

# Informal proof: \nTo prove that if 3 divides c and 3² divides 3c, then 3 divides c, we'll use a logical approach focusing on the properties of divisibility and prime numbers. Here's a proof-oriented reasoning path:\n\n1. Let's start with our given conditions:\n   a. 3 divides c\n   b. 3² divides 3c\n\n2. From condition (a), we can express c as:\n   c = 3k, where k is some integer\n\n3. Now, let's consider condition (b). We can write this as:\n   3² divides 3(3k)\n\n4. Simplifying the right side:\n   3² divides 9k\n\n5. Since 3² = 9, this is equivalent to saying:\n   9 divides 9k\n\n6. This last statement is always true for any integer k, so condition (b) doesn't actually add any new information to what we already knew from condition (a).\n\n7. Therefore, the implication \"3² divides 3c implies 3 divides c\" is trivially true, because we already know that 3 divides c from the first condition.\n\n8. We can conclude that if 3 divides c and 3² divides 3c, then 3 divides c.\n\n9. Note that this proof doesn't require us to use the full strength of the second condition. The crucial part is recognizing that the second condition is always satisfied when the first condition is true.
